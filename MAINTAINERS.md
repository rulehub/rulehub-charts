# MAINTAINERS

Canonical list of active maintainers for this chart. Use this file to:

- Discover who can review / approve changes.
- Identify area subject matter contacts.
- Track role coverage and onboarding gaps.

Update rules:

1. Propose additions/removals via PR (include rationale in description).
2. At least one existing maintainer must approve maintainer list changes.
3. Keep entries alphabetized by GitHub handle.
4. Keep scope Areas concise (comma-separated keywords: policies, schema, docs, release, supply-chain, performance, tooling, governance, security, provenance, automation).

| Name | GitHub | Role | Areas |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| (placeholder) | @example | Lead | release, governance, supply-chain |
| (add more) | @handle | Maintainer | policies, schema |

Legend:

- Role: Lead (primary decision facilitator), Maintainer (general reviewer/merger), Contributor (transitioning / limited scope), Emeritus (historical, no active duties).

Process Notes:

- At least 2 maintainers recommended for bus factor; aim for diverse area coverage.
- Rotate release duties; record handoff in PR descriptions for major releases.
- Use CODEOWNERS (future task) to align automated review requests with Areas.

This file intentionally minimal; expand only when governance doc is added.
