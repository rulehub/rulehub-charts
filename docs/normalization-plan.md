# Normalization note

This chart is in active development and has not published a first stable release. The project uses a single canonical key style (kebab-case) and does not maintain deprecation or migration windows prior to the first public release.

If aliasing or migration paths are needed after GA, the team will add a short, targeted plan at that time.
